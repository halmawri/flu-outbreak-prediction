📊 Flu Outbreak Prediction Capstone Project  

This repository contains the code, data, and documentation for my **Capstone Project** on **Predicting Flu Outbreaks** using **Time Series Analysis and Machine Learning**. The project aims to **forecast flu outbreaks** using **CDC historical data** and **Google Trends search volumes**, leveraging advanced **machine learning** and **deep learning** models like **ARIMA, LSTM, Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**.

## 🚀 Key Features  
- **Automated Data Collection:** Fetch historical flu data from **CDC** and **Google Trends**.  
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, duplicates, and data standardization.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identify trends and correlations in the data.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Train and optimize models for accurate predictions.  
- **Performance Evaluation:** Validate model performance using cross-validation.  
- **Deployment:** Prepare the final model for real-time predictions.
