# Model Development Report

## Overview
This report summarizes the model development phase (Step 5) of the flu outbreak prediction project.

## Models Trained
1. **Linear Models**: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso
2. **Time Series Model**: ARIMA(1,1,1)
3. **Tree-based Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost
4. **Neural Network**: LSTM
5. **Ensemble Models**: Average and Weighted ensembles

## Performance Results
| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² |
|-------|-----|------|----|
| Random Forest (optimized) | 0.5117 | 0.6771 | 0.8268 |
| XGBoost (optimized) | 0.5476 | 0.6808 | 0.8249 |
