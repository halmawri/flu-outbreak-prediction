# Model Validation Report - Step 6

## Executive Summary
This report presents the comprehensive validation of flu outbreak prediction models, following Step 6 of the capstone proposal. The analysis includes cross-validation, advanced metrics evaluation, seasonal performance testing, and model interpretability analysis.

## 1. Cross-Validation Results
Time series cross-validation was performed using 5 folds to ensure models are robust across different time periods.

### Best Performing Models (by CV MAE):
3. **Lasso**: MAE = 0.5702 (±0.1140)
4. **Random Forest**: MAE = 0.6082 (±0.1176)
5. **XGBoost**: MAE = 0.6313 (±0.0852)

## 2. Advanced Evaluation Metrics
Comprehensive evaluation using multiple metrics:

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² | MAPE | Accuracy within 0.5% |
|-------|-----|------|----|----- |---------------------|
| Random Forest | 0.5117 | 0.6771 | 0.8268 | 198.87% | 65.0% |
| XGBoost | 0.5476 | 0.6808 | 0.8249 | 163.40% | 50.0% |
| Lasso | 0.5831 | 0.6946 | 0.8177 | 268.02% | 50.0% |
| Ridge | 0.5853 | 0.7638 | 0.7795 | 246.40% | 65.0% |
| Linear Regression | 7.4701 | 9.8181 | -35.4284 | 1816.49% | 0.0% |

## 3. Seasonal Performance Analysis
Analysis of Random Forest performance across seasons:

| Season | Mean MAE | Std MAE | Sample Count |
|--------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Fall | 0.3863 | 0.2400 | 6 |
| Spring | 0.8103 | 0.5922 | 3 |
| Summer | 0.4705 | 0.5523 | 6 |
| Winter | 0.5326 | 0.5105 | 5 |

## 4. Model Interpretability
SHAP analysis was performed to understand feature importance and model decisions.

### Key Findings:
- SHAP analysis provides insights into which features drive predictions
- Feature importance varies across different model types
- Lagged search terms consistently show high importance

## 5. Key Validation Insights
1. **Best Cross-Validated Model**: Lasso (MAE: 0.5702 ±0.1140)
2. **Model Stability**: Cross-validation shows consistent performance across time periods
3. **Seasonal Variation**: Model performance varies by season, with patterns reflecting flu seasonality
4. **Feature Importance**: Lagged search terms are consistently important across models

## 6. Recommendations
Based on the validation results:

1. **Deploy Lasso** as the primary prediction model
2. **Monitor seasonal performance** and consider seasonal model adjustments
3. **Focus on key features** identified through SHAP analysis for model simplification
4. **Implement continuous validation** as new data becomes available
